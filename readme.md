## Site Description

The Site uses AJAX-type requests (using XMLHttpRequest).

The website's frontend sends AJAX requests to PHP scripts to get the data needed by the application or to update the application's content on the server. Using AJAX it is possible to update the chat content in real time among other things. Chat makes new AJAX requests to update chat content every 5 seconds. After making the AJAX requests, PHP returns a JSON with related data to the frontend, and the frontend treats this data and displays whatever is necessary on the screen.

PHP scripts upload files (images or videos) sent via AJAX and store them on the server.

User information is being stored in the database, while messages, file path, chat information among other things are stored in JSON files. Both are updated via AJAX requests.

The website design was created using Figma (one day I will make better designs).

The site will act responsively on small, medium and large devices.
